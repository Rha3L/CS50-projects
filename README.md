### 3. Substitution cipher

It encrypts a message by replacing every letter with another letter. It requires a key, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when encrypting it. To decrypt the message, the receiver would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text back into the original message.
